Expose 802.1x (e.g. eduroam) connection via second wifi (i.e. access point)

This script is for my own personal notes. It configures a raspberry pi to connect to an 802.1x network and then exposes this via an unencrypted access point. This is just a proof of principle and you are very likely break your universities terms and conditions if you do this. The script needs adjustment to run (see XXXs) and will be run at your own risk.
